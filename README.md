  Real-time screenshot detection for React Native apps
</h3>

## Features

- 🚀 Real-time screenshot detection
- 🔄 Cross-platform support (iOS & Android)
- 🎣 Easy-to-use React hooks
- ⚡ Optimized for performance
- 📱 Supports Android 14+ (API level 34+) and iOS 14+
- 🏗️ Supports the new architecture for React Native

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-screenshot-aware
```
or
```sh
npm install react-native-screenshot-aware
```

## Important Notes

### Android
- Supports Android 14+ (API level 34 and above)
- Utilizes the latest Android API for efficient screenshot detection
- Leverages the new `DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE` permission introduced in Android 14
- Provides a more privacy-friendly and performant approach to screenshot detection

### Permissions

To use the screenshot detection feature on Android, you need to add the following permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE" />
```

> **Note**: Callbacks will never be triggered on devices running Android versions below 14. This is due to the reliance on the new `DETECT_SCREEN_CAPTURE` permission and APIs introduced in Android 14, which are not available in earlier versions.

> **Note**: The decision to support only Android 14+ is based on the introduction of new, dedicated screenshot detection APIs. These APIs offer improved performance and respect user privacy better than previous methods. For more details, see the [Android 14 screenshot detection documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/features/screenshot-detection).

### `addListener(callback)`

This function allows you to add a listener for the screenshot event. It takes a callback function as an argument, which will be executed whenever a screenshot event is detected.
